# AUPrint
AUPrint is a Mac OS X app for students at Aarhus University to easily add one of the printers around the campus.

The app uses the Generic PostScript Printer driver for the printer, so any special features wonâ€™t be accessible. For that you have to download a driver and add the printer yourself. The app does contain printer information and SMB URLs for all printers.
